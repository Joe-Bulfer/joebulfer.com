> ⚠️: **Trigger Warning**: I know Rust is a well loved language by those that use it and clearly it is useful in some areas considering its wide adoption. I haven't used Rust extensively and keep in mind these are just my opinions.

> 📝️ **Video Transcript**: This is the transcript for a video on my youtube channel. It should still be just as readable as an article, but you can also find the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ApyTHAXyfU).

> 🔔 **Most Recent Video**: Titled [Why I Change From C to Python](https://youtu.be/pgIV4jQuckk?si=Lnp_1J5so5-Oegw1). Really it's more about C programming with Raylib, than about Python. Raylib is a simple game development library which will be the topic of my next video.
