> ðŸ”” **Most Recent Video**: Titled [Why I Change From C to Python](https://youtu.be/pgIV4jQuckk?si=Lnp_1J5so5-Oegw1). Really it's more about C programming with Raylib, than about Python. Raylib is a simple game development library which will be the topic of my next video.

Welcome to my Website! This will serve as the place for my more formatted and organized writing.

I am an undergraduate computer science student who has been programming and taking apart computers since I was was young. Linux has been a major interest as a hobby as well as in professional pursuit of certifications and employment. Various other interests are as follows:

- Obsidian, a note taking app which I created my own [plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=disk%20usage) for, which measures aggregated file sizes (over 2k downloads).

- Godot, an open source game engine. I am specifically interested in creating 2d gravity simulations like [this](https://space-explorer.pages.dev/).

- Building websites with zero to minimal Javascript, such as simple staticly generated websites that you are likely reading this from.

- Ruby and Go. Both cool programming languages.

Many articles, notes, pages, etc. on here will have an accompanying youtube video, and vice versa. You can see my youtube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/@joebulfer)
